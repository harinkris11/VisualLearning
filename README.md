Visual Learning Assignments in PyTorch

This repository contains assignments and projects focused on computer vision topics implemented using the PyTorch framework. The assignments aim to provide hands-on experience with visual learning techniques, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Assignment X: Each assignment is organized in a separate folder labeled as "Assignment X" (where "X" represents the assignment number). Inside each folder, you will find the Python script files, datasets used, and any additional resources required to complete the assignment.

README.md: This README file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

Prerequisites
To run the assignments, you should have Python and PyTorch installed on your machine. Additionally, some assignments may require specific libraries or packages, which will be mentioned in the individual assignment folders.

Running the Assignments
To run the assignments, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the assignment folder (e.g., "Assignment 1") that you wish to work on.

Install any required packages or libraries mentioned in the README file or script.

Run the Python script associated with the assignment.

Modify the code or experiment with different parameters as instructed to explore and learn visual learning techniques.

Please note that some assignments may include pre-trained models or datasets. Ensure that the necessary data files are available or follow the instructions to download them.

Contributions
Contributions to this repository, such as bug fixes, additional assignments, or enhancements, are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please follow the standard GitHub workflow by forking the repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.

Disclaimer
The assignments in this repository are designed for educational purposes and aim to provide practical experience in computer vision using PyTorch. The implementations may not represent optimal or state-of-the-art solutions. Use the code and materials at your own discretion.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository.

Happy learning!
